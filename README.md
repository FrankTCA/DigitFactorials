# Digit Factorials
I am learning Swift for AP CSA, so I have uploaded this. Basically, this will go through numbers, and then determine the factorials of each of their digits, add them together and then see if they equal the number.

## Binaries
I will upload a binary in Releases, so you can check that out. It will work on any mac with Apple Silicon.
